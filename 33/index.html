      <p>Coding to the day 15 prompt of "Sine waves" from genuary.</p>
      <p>This is my first time playing with sine waves in code, ever. Never had to use this at work nor at play. Frankly I had forgotten almost everything I'd learned from school about these things. Thankfully Daniel Shiffman got us covered! I used the video linked below as a primer.</p>
      <p>What's happening here is that I use a sine function on an angle variable (init to 0), which will return a value from -1 to 1. I increment the angle by roughly 0.1 with each draw cycle and calculate the new position of the dot. And since I already have a beautifully smooth varying number to use for position, I also used it to determine the dot's size between 0 and 10px. Lastly, I used a nested loop to create a lot more dots!</p>
