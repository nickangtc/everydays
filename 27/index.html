      <p>Genuary 2023 day 9 prompt: Plants.</p>
      <p>as with yesterday I found myself in a creative rut unable to come up with any interpretation of "plants," so I started looking online for inspiration. Searched the hashtag #genuary9 and found <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CnLjIhiy5LL/">this piece by okazzsp</a> that I liked and I'll try to replicate it.</p>
      <p>I couldn't figure out how to make the petals of the flower... it's not so simple since it needs to run along the periphery of the center of the flower. One must rotate around the center of the flower, draw a petal at the top, and rotate the rest of the drawing, and draw a petal at the top again and stop eventually. The number of petals must be pre-calculated or else there will be unpredictable overlaps. Also, what shape should the petals be?</p>
      <p>in the end I copied <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1787506">the code</a> from the artist linked above and commented out code to try and deconstruct it to learn how it works. Without diving deeper into what a <strong>"vertex"</strong> is and what are the significance of the constant <strong>TAU</strong> and the <strong>sine and cosine</strong> functions, I won't be able to fully understand what is going on.</p>
      <p>in other words, if I want to create these shapes I'll need to re-learn some math and apply them.</p>
      <p>generative art surprisingly calls for more math than software engineering on a day to day basis!</p>
