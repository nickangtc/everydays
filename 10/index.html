      <p>Read a little more about creative coding this morning when I was supposed to be diving into code immediately. I think it was a needed detour. Anyway, I found another <a href="https://timrodenbroeker.de/what-is-creative-coding/">good article</a> that references p5.js for drawing on web.</p>
      <p>Alright, p5.js, I'm ready to fiddle with you! This is the first time in this project that I'm loading an external library - everything so far has been coded by hand (with some Github Copilot assistance). I wouldn't say I've nailed down the basics of HTML <code>canvas</code> at this point and am graduating to using a library that is built on top of that. No, far from that. I just feel ready to move one level higher in the abstraction stack to try other interesting things.</p>
      <p>Basic setup of p5 is simple enough. Downloaded locally, hosting on github, loading, and calling two functions. Already seeing interactivity on the canvas!</p>
      <p>Nothing masterful came out of this session... I just learned how the basic p5 API works. And the emojis are the emotions I felt in this session.</p>
