      <p>prompt: write a JS program that generates art</p>
      <p>when I asked ChatGPT what it would call this piece of art, it replied:</p>
      <p><em>It's difficult to give this piece of art a specific name because it is generated randomly. Since it is created using a computer program, it could be called "computer-generated art" or "algorithmic art". The program itself is simply a basic example, so it could be called something like "random art generator" or "bouncing rectangle art". Ultimately, the name of the art would depend on the context in which it is presented and the intended meaning or message behind it.</em></p>

      <p>A funny thing happened when I tried to write the <code>drawHuman</code> function - <em>another</em> AI came to assist: Github Copilot. Ahh, 2022.</p>
      <p>I know nothing about <code>canvas</code> HTML element and am reading about it now from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_usage">MDN tutorial</a>...</p>
      <p>I still know very little about <code>canvas</code> other than how to fill and clear rectangles of different sizes with colours.</p>
