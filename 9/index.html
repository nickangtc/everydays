      <p>Read a nice article on <a href="https://dry.ly/on-creative-coding">creative coding</a> this morning for a start. It made me feel inspired but also kind of shitty because I'm not inspired enough to know what to create today, especially when I think about how it will compare to what the author of that article has done.</p>
      <p>In case you're wondering why this is so titled, it's because I used to draw dots and link them together with straight lines whenever I'm bored listening to the teacher at university. I would draw many dots and challenge myself to find all the links to be drawn. Each additional node increases the challenge exponential as it had to be linked to all the other dots!</p>
