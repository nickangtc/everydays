  <h1>5706 consecutive days of art in 1 minute</h1>
  <p>Based on <a href="https://www.beeple-crap.com/">beeple's</a> prolific art creation.</p>

  <button id="collapse-toggle">Notes</button>
  <section class="collapsible">
    <p>First things first, I need to do the necessary fiddly work of finding a simple structure that makes the URL work simply by /1, /2, etc. I think that's going to be important in the long run for finding stuff.</p>
    <p>Okay just deployed, structure is good now.</p>
    <p>Maybe I should move these to footnotes.</p>
    <p>So... is there some coding already required here? How do I write text but keep them collapsed? A collapsible component would work for sure.</p>
    <p>But before building, let's just be clear on why I think it'd be good to be able to embed notes this close to the day's project itself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I won't ever lose the thinking process and notes around each day's project.</li>
      <li>I expect I'll need to link out to sources of inspiration/reference often.</li>
      <li>Because I can?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Okay collapsible, done. I'll probably reuse this in the following pieces. Now on to doing something for fun.</p>
    <p>The timing calculations were super off... I thought it'd be much easier than it turned out. I think I'm missing a variable or misinterpretating the meaning of one of them. Ended up getting to roughly 1 minute of painting by trial and error of tweaking numbers assigned to some variables. Whatever, it works.</p>
