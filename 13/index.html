      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>My goal is to make a random Perlin walker that isn't so random but instead tends to move roughly in the direction of the mouse.</p>
      <p>Ah it's nice to not have to code from web API to determine mouse events. Just using `mouseX` and `mouseY` works with p5.js. Happy magic.</p>
      <p>Okay, I failed miserably with this one. Beaten by the math part - I couldn't figure out how to use Perlin walker (a pseudo-random number generator 0 to 1) to determine the next position for a walker on the canvas AND make it biased toward mouse position. Without the bias, it's just the <a href="../11/">Perlin walker</a> done a few days ago.</p>
      <p>Since I messed up this one I renamed it to something else than I originally intended to name it.</p>
      <p>Spent more time than I could afford on this one and still failed to produce what I wanted. Felt sucky, but I'm telling myself this is part of making art that relies on algorithms and math - you don't always get all of them right!</p>
